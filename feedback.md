# Project 1 Evaluation
## Deployment:

### 3: Excelling

Did you successfully deploy your project to github pages? Is the app's functionality the same deployed as it is locally?

## Technical Requirements:

### 3: Excelling

Did you deliver a project that met all the technical requirements? Given what the class has covered so far, did you build something that was reasonably complex?

## Code Quality:

### 2: Progressing

Did you follow code style guidance and best practices covered in class, such as spacing, modularity, and semantic naming? Did you comment your code?

## Creativity/Interface:

### 3: Excelling

Is your user interface easy to use and understand? Does it make sense for the problem you're solving? Does your interface demonstrate creative design?

## Notes
Notes:
* Great job on this project. You broke your code down into smaller components which is really helpful! I like the ability to pick a picture and how they changed when hovered!
* You may want to reduce the comments a bit, but that's a stylistic choice. I agree with [this](https://blog.codinghorror.com/code-tells-you-how-comments-tell-you-why/) link on comments.
* Your CSS is great! I would look into making the site more responsive so it works at different browser sizes. I also may change the font or increase the size so it's easier to read!
* I would focus on making your code a bit more consistent with things like spacing and indentation!

## Things you'd like specific feedback on: 

**On the StartGame Function, how to make it cleaner.** 
I left some inline comments, but I would change the duplicated code from startGame2 and make that into smaller functions!
